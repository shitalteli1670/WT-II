Review
The movie was fantastic! I loved it.
"It was an average film, not too bad."
I didn't like the movie. It was boring.
An absolute masterpiece! Highly recommend it.
Not my type of movie. The story was dull.
Great performances by the actors!
The script was weak and predictable.
A must-watch for action movie fans!
"It had a few good moments, but overall, disappointing."
"Loved the cinematography, but the plot was lacking."
